Whenever this rule file is executed, it should look at the last task that was done.
If the task includes anything visual, like a canvas, layout, UI, or anything that needs to be seen on screen, then the output should list things that need to be tested.

The output should always say things like:

“This needs to be tested.”

“The color on this needs to be good.”

“The contrast of this needs to be checked out.”

“Is everything working okay?”

After listing those, it should always ask for feedback in a clear way, like:

“Give me feedback on the layout.”

“Give me feedback on the colors.”

“Give me feedback on the interaction or behavior.”

The output should always follow this structure:

First, list all the things that need to be tested.
Then, list all the things you want feedback on.

If the last task was not visual, then don’t output anything.
