# Task 0008: Dispatcher with max_workers=10 and bounded queue

## Summary

ThreadPoolExecutor (I/O bound) capped at 10; backpressure to avoid unbounded memory.

## Prerequisites

- [ ] None

## Objective (Outcomes)

- ThreadPoolExecutor (I/O bound) capped at 10; backpressure to avoid unbounded memory.

## Scope

### In-Scope

- ThreadPoolExecutor with max_workers=10
- Bounded queue for backpressure control
- Task submission and completion tracking
- Graceful shutdown handling

### Out-of-Scope

- ProcessPoolExecutor for CPU-bound tasks
- Dynamic worker scaling
- Distributed task processing

## Components to Install

- concurrent.futures (built-in Python)
- queue (built-in Python)

## Commands

None specified.

## File Changes

None specified.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Given N>10 enqueued files, Then only 10 run concurrently and queue drains

## Verification

- Test: Submit >10 tasks and verify concurrency limit
- Check: Memory usage remains bounded under load
- Evidence to capture: concurrent task counts, queue metrics

## Rollback

None specified.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Tests updated/passing
- [ ] Docs updated
- [ ] Observability updated (if applicable)
- [ ] task_summary.md created under summaries/tasks/TASK-0008-summary.md
